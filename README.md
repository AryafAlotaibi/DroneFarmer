# DroneFarmer
DroneFarmer is a simulated agricultural drone system for No-Till Farming. It simulates autonomous seed dispersal and GPS tracking in a zigzag pattern, demonstrating the concept of smart, automated farming without human intervention or plowing.

# Features

- **Autonomous Flight Path**: Simulates a zigzag path over the field.
- **No-Till Simulation**: Mimics seed dispersal without plowing or human involvement.
- **GPS Logging**: Captures GPS coordinates at each simulated seed drop.
- **Simulated Image Capture**: Future functionality for real-time crop monitoring (currently simulated).
- **Battery Monitoring Logic**: Simulates a return-to-launch or landing behavior when the battery is low, ensuring safe operation.

  
For detailed instructions on how to set up **PX4** and run the **jMAVSim** simulation, refer to the
